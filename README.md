World Happiness Report

According to the World Happiness Report, 6 factors can determine the happiness of a country. Those 6 factors are: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. We will use multiple sources to obtain this data based on The World Happiness Report. We will merge the data into one table in Postgres.
